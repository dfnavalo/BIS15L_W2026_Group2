## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r}
surgery <- read_csv("data/surgery.csv") %>% 
  clean_names()
```
1. What are the variable names?
```{r}
names(surgery)
```
2.What is the distribution of patient age and race?
```{r}
surgery %>% 
  filter(race!="NA") %>% 
  group_by(race) %>% 
  summarise(
    n = n(),
    min_age=min(age, na.rm = T),
    max_age=max(age, na.rm = T),
    mean_age = mean(age, na.rm = T),
    median_age = median(age, na.rm = T)
  ) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```


3.
```{r}

```
